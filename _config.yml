  I am a <b>data scientist</b> who enjoys drawing knowledge and insights from data and thinks data always has a better idea. 
  <br>
  I have graduated summa cum laude with a <b>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering (CGPA of 3.92) from Nile University</b>, where I received solid training in all the major fields of computer engineering.
  <br>
  I have acquired multiple certificates for various data science and AI courses via <b>Coursera</b>, <b>Udacity</b>, and others (listed below in the Certificates section).
  <br>
  I consider myself a passionate, hard-working, empathetic, and determined person. I am also a fast-learner with a creative attitude to problem-solving. To put it simply, I am pragmatic and organized, yet flexible.
  <br>
  My ultimate goal in life is to <b>use AI to make the world a better place for all humanity</b>.
